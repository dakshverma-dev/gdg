                         CARESRE - REMAINING TASKS
================================================================================

COMPLETED ✅
============
- Patient Registration Form (enhanced with medical history)
- Document Upload with AI Analysis (Gemini Vision)
- Compact OPD Slip with QR Code
- Doctor Portal with Queue Management
- Smart Keyword-based Triage (fallback when AI unavailable)
- Admin Dashboard
- All 6 AI Agents working

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HIGH PRIORITY - TODO
====================

1. FIREBASE INTEGRATION
   - Current: Using in-memory store (data lost on server restart)
   - Needed: Persist patient data to Firebase Realtime Database
   
   Files to update:
   - src/lib/store.ts → Replace with Firebase operations
   - src/lib/firebase.ts → Already has config, needs CRUD functions
   
   Steps:
   a) Initialize Firebase Admin SDK on server
   b) Create collections: patients, alerts, queue_stats
   c) Update addPatient, getPatients, updatePatientStatus to use Firebase
   d) Test data persistence across restarts

2. GEMINI API KEY
   - Current key may be invalid/expired (getting auth errors)
   - Get a fresh key from: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
   - Update in .env.local: GEMINI_API_KEY=your_new_key
   - The keyword fallback works but full AI is better

3. AUTHENTICATION
   - No login system currently
   - Needed: Separate logins for doctors/admin/reception
   - Use Firebase Authentication
   - Add role-based access control


MEDIUM PRIORITY - ENHANCEMENTS
==============================

4. SMS/WhatsApp Notifications
   - Send token and queue updates to patient's phone
   - Integrate Twilio or similar service
   - Notify when turn is approaching

5. Real-time Queue Updates
   - Use WebSockets or Firebase Realtime listeners
   - Auto-update patient/doctor dashboards
   - Show live queue position changes

6. Patient History Lookup
   - For follow-up visits, fetch previous records
   - Show past visits, medications, diagnoses
   - Requires Firebase patient history

7. Doctor Selection
   - Allow assigning specific doctors to patients
   - Show doctor availability status
   - Load balancing across doctors

8. Reports & Analytics
   - Daily patient count
   - Average wait times
   - Department-wise statistics
   - Export to PDF/Excel


LOW PRIORITY - NICE TO HAVE
===========================

9. Multi-language Support (Hindi, regional languages)

10. Voice Input for symptoms (accessibility)

11. Appointment Booking (for future dates)

12. Medicine Prescription Module

13. Lab Test Integration

14. Feedback/Rating System
